#? Second-Suit-Half-Off Sale A menâ€™s clothing store advertises that if you buy a suit,
#? you can get a second suit at half-off. What they mean is that if you buy two suits, then
#? the price of the lower-cost suit is reduced by 50%. Write a program that accepts the
#? two costs as input and then calculates the total cost after halving the cost of the lowest
#? price suit. See Fig.



cost1 = float(input("Enter cost of first suit: "))
cost2 = float(input("Enter cost of second suit: "))
twoCosts = [cost1, cost2]
cost = max(twoCosts) + (.5 * min(twoCosts))
print("Cost of the two suits is ${0:.2f}".format(cost))
